# CSUSM-Cybersec-Club
General Repo for Cybersecurity Club - Fall 2022

- Meetings are generally 12-2 on Tuesdays
- We try to record any meetings and they should be posted into this repo under recordings


## Hey, here's some info to get started
- First, and obviously we shouldn't have to remind you, don't intentionally misuse any of the tools for any malicious purpose. We want to promote ethical engineering 
principles outlined by NSPE, and our university. 

### Things you _should_ get, if you haven't already (or consider becoming familiar with):
- Github, should already have
- Oracle VM, VirtualBox, any virtual machine of your choice
- Kali Linux, has a big majority of the tools we use (hashcat, jtr, burp suite)
- Consider downloading the most recent Ubuntu release, become familiar with linux
- Disassembly programs: IDA Free and/or Ghidra, may need custom debuggers for particular challenges
- Whether you use Firefox, Chrome, or whatever it sometimes helps have extensions for managing cookies and switching user-agent easily
- Become familiar with CyberChef, this tool is amazing and I use it for everything 
- Check https://github.com/trailofbits/ctf for information on various CTF topics / challenges
- Always check ctftime.org for upcoming challenges, most are free and open to public, experience is the greatest teacher in this field
